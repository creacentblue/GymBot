To start building this app, I recommend following these steps:
1.Project Setup
    Create a new Android project in Android Studio
    Set up Firebase project and integrate it with your app
    Configure necessary dependencies in your build.gradle files
2.Core Features Implementation
    Start with user authentication
    Create the database schema for workouts and diet tracking
    Implement the main UI components
    Add data persistence using Room database for offline functionality
3.Recommended Project Structure
    Use MVVM architecture
    Implement Repository pattern
    Use Dependency Injection (Hilt/Dagger)
    Follow Material Design guidelines

Would you like me to help you with any specific aspect of the implementation? For example, we could start with:
    Project setup and configuration
    Database schema design
    UI/UX implementation
    Authentication system
    Specific feature implementation
